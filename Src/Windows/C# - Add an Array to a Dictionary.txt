An array is string[], not List<string>, so just do this:

Dictionary<string, string[]> wordDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string[]>();

Now you can add your array as usual.

wordDictionary.Add("IN", IN);

Or:

wordDictionary.Add("IN", new string[] {"Against","Like","Upon","Through","Of","With","Upon","On","Into","From","by","that","In","About","For","Along","Before","Beneath","At","Across","beside","After","Though","Among","Toward","If"});
