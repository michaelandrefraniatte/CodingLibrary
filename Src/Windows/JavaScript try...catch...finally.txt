The try...catch...finally statements combo handles errors without stopping JavaScript.

The try statement defines the code block to run (to try).

The catch statement defines a code block to handle any error.

The finally statement defines a code block to run regardless of the result.

The throw statement defines a custom error.

Both catch and finally are optional, but you must use one of them.
