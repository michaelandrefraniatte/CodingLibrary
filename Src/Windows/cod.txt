- There are viruses in all Call of Duty games of the franchise, just if you enable Windows Defender to highest level, not only in diagnosis mode, the game won't start, and you are forced to disable the security, that let you be to restore your PC from factory, for enable again the diagnosis mode or Windows defender to highest level, while all other games start
- It's so trash that it eat all your energy of a day just to play one match with cheaters or not even one
- Devs don't want to enable Adress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), so they don't care about the community around their games
- The gameplay is horrible, aiming is like moving a pen in a poop, and firing is like pushing in, but players are loving it for it, they like to play like this apparently
- It's easy to recognize it's only cheaters, when there is an update it's playable 1 day with only big tard noobs running in front of you, but after it's unplayable
- The servers are own by hackers opening servers in all other games not legit
- Even if the franchise is own by Microsoft now, nothing can change, it will be even worst because the whole community around the games of the franchise are only noob cheaters, and they want for their money
- It asking to buy a new PC each year with the new game, you breaking a little more each time you playing, sometimes worst than other times
- The games are anti third tool controller support not allowing to use k/m and gamepad at same time, and it's not to avoid aimboting, it would only support newest xinput controllers, it would be the same, very soon, but in fact xinput handle is the same for all generations of xinput controllers, it wouldn't surprise me, it block from the generation name as simple as that, finding another excuse, like the games ask better control for less aim assist, and k/m players raging less for it, complaining too much actually against console players using aim assist
- Playing the game drive you crazy, and you will make very bad things in your life you will regret later
