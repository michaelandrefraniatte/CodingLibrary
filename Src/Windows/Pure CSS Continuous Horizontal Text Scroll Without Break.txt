You could try having two marquees and set one of them with a delayed animation of 2.5s which is half the time of the full animation (5s).

.marquee {
  margin: 0 auto;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
}

.marquee span {
  display: inline-block;
  padding-left: 100%;
  animation: marquee 5s linear infinite;
}

.marquee2 span {
  animation-delay: 2.5s;
}

@keyframes marquee {
  0% {
    transform: translate(0, 0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translate(-100%, 0);
  }
}

<p class="marquee">
  <span>This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text -&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p class="marquee marquee2">
  <span>This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text - This is text -&nbsp;</span>
</p>

Just a comment: there is no need to duplicated the keyframes (marquee2) for this concept to work. – Jonathan Aug 23 '17 at 19:19

@rmurph46 Cleaned up your answer a bit to reduce redundant code, fix a bug and brought it to a Stack Snippet. Good work! – Jon Uleis Aug 23 '17 at 19:23

If the text is too short you can continue to duplicate the marquees and adjust the animation delays. Alternatively you can use js to remove/add the class with the animation at specific time intervals but @lgants wanted pure css/html. – rmurph46 Aug 23 '17 at 19:36

I was able to make the text start from the left by adding a negative animation delay to the first span and setting the second span to have no delay. .marquee1 span {   animation-delay: -2.5s; } .marquee2 span {   animation-delay: 0s; } 

@keyframes slide {
  from {
    background-position-x: 0;
  }
  to {
    background-position-x: -100%;
  }
}

.container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 18px;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml;utf8,\
<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='300'>\
  <text x='0' y='18'>hello world foo bar fizz buzz lorem ipsum</text>\
</svg>\
");
  background-repeat: repeat;
  background-size: auto;
  animation: 5s linear infinite slide;
}
