This is a known issue which has been fixed in the latest prerelease package that I tested (1.0.790-prerelease) but unfortunately not in the last stable release before that. So if you are using the latest prerelease version, that would be enough to call:

webView21.Focus();

Older versions:

But as a workaround, you can subscribe to NavigationCompleted, then find the browser child window and set the focus:

public const uint GW_CHILD = 5;
[DllImport("user32.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr GetWindow(IntPtr hWnd, uint uCmd);
[DllImport("user32.dll")]
public static extern IntPtr SetFocus(IntPtr hWnd);

WebView2 webView21 = new Microsoft.Web.WebView2.WinForms.WebView2();
private async void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    webView21.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
    this.Controls.Add(webView21);
    await webView21.EnsureCoreWebView2Async();
    webView21.Source = new Uri("https://bing.com");

    webView21.NavigationCompleted += WebView21_NavigationCompleted;
}

private void WebView21_NavigationCompleted(
    object sender, CoreWebView2NavigationCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    var child = GetWindow(webView21.Handle, GW_CHILD);
    SetFocus(child);
}
