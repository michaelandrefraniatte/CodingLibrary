First create an image using the total width & height. Need to calculate the width & height from the images which are going to stitch on a single image. Now use below code to stitch:

using (Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(cal_width, cal_height))
{
    using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp))
    {
        g.DrawImage(img1,x1,y1,w1,h1);
        g.DrawImage(img2, x2, y2, w2, h2);
        g.DrawImage(img3, x3, y3, w3, h3);
        g.DrawImage(img4, x4, y4, w4, h4);
    }
}
bmp will the desired image. x1,y1...x4,y4 are the positions of the top left point from where you start place the image. These positions need to calculate in respective to the final image. Also place the width & height of the images using w1,h1...w4,h4
