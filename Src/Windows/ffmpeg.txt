- Prefer to use Geforce Experience for record and stream videos instead of ffmpeg, because with bad settings it destroy a little your PC
- Capturing with GeForce Experience for uploading on Youtube need to set parameters as following :
Game with best graphisms and highest resolution of your game screen, while not encounter lags, or better choosing native resolution but upscaling after capture with ffmpeg
720p, 30 FPS, 15 Mbits/s, or 1440p, 30 FPS, 30 MBits/s, or 4k, 30 FPS, 50 Mbits/s, with in game resolution, in video settings of Geforce
Allow capturing desktop if using webcam and if using WebcamOverlay in confidentiality settings of Geforce, but resolution of video will be the resolution of your monitor screen 
Disable game capture in Windows settings and restart your computer
To embed a video in Html5 video tag instead of using Youtube iframe, I advice you to rezise video with bitrate using cmd command "ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 6M output.mp4", because video tag aren't compressing video like Youtube is doing and so low connexion can't watch your video
It's made for avoid loss of video quality while uploading on Youtube, and not having low resolution badly compressed by Youtube, so you can use the cmd command "ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=3840:2160:flags=neighbor -b:v 15M output.mp4" for transforming to 4k your video before uploading on Youtube
- With ffmpeg you can paste several videos one after the others
Make input.txt containing the following:
	file 'input1.mp4'
	file 'input2.mp4'
	file 'input3.mp4'
Concatenate:
	ffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4
- With ffmpeg you can crop in time a video without the need of an encoder useless for this purpose
ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mp4
