- I do not recommand to spend money in virtual reality because of the following reasons
The helmet is heavy to wear, and moving with is really uncomfortable
The opticals are low field of view and low resolution, just a screen in front of your eyes with no peripheral vision
There's no accessories like a gun, a arch, a racing steering wheel, a moto straffing, there's only a splitted gamepad
The game engines and games are not coded and imagined specially for be used with it, it's just tweak of motion inputs, and special screen outputs, no more
