I need select waveout device, to play sound. But I cant do that.

void Initialize()
{
_WaveOut = new WaveOut();
var reader = new WaveFileReader(FileName);
_WaveOut.Init(new WaveChannel32(reader));
}

This function starts, then the form start. After this on my form, I select waveout device with combobox. Combobox is filles with this code:

for (int i = 0; i < WaveOut.DeviceCount; i++)
{
     WaveOutCapabilities WOC = WaveOut.GetCapabilities(i);
     comboBox2.Items.Add(WOC.ProductName);

}
After this, I select my device.

int WaveOutDeviceId = comboBox2.SelectedIndex;

And start Play function:

void Play()
{
_WaveOut.DeviceNumber = WaveOutDeviceId;
_WaveOut.Play();
}

But my sound always play on default device (With number = 0). If I do this for microphone, this code works correctly.

Once you've called Init it's too late to change DeviceId. I suggest creating a new instance of WaveOut when you want to change device.

public void playSound(int deviceNumber)
{
    disposeWave();// stop previous sounds before starting
    waveReader = new NAudio.Wave.WaveFileReader(fileName);
    var waveOut = new NAudio.Wave.WaveOut();
    waveOut.DeviceNumber = deviceNumber;
    waveOut.Init(waveReader);
    waveOut.Play();
}
