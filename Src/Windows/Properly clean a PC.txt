To properly clean your PC, if you use a dry air bomb, do not shake the bomb during use to prevent the gas in liquid form from escaping, propulsion of dry air must be done in small short bursts and it is better to stop as soon as the bomb becomes cold, otherwise the gas in liquid form is escaping, if so, let your PC dry at least 24 hours, and don't plug alimentation and anything before, but in any cases prefer to use a simple vacuum cleaner with brush attachment
