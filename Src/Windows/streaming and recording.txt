- Prefer to record or stream with GeforceExperience and show your contents on Youtube
- If you want streaming or recording, it's better to use GeForce Experience if you have a Nvidia card, in this case, lower to minimum the audio quality from audio card settings, to not have unsynchronisation of audio and video, and disable all audio cards useless
- GeForce experience with latest driver for Nvidia graphic card is a must have for streaming and recording
- If you have a fiber internet conncetion, you can stream with all highest settings (1080p, 60 or 30 fps, 18 Mb/s) on Youtube
- If you don't have a good internet connection you can record games and desktop with higher quality and upload on Youtube
- You just need a webcam with integrated microphone you connect via USB and start your PC, use predefined shortcuts
- Enable desktop capture under confidentiality parameter in order to have some custom overlays
- Set your game in windowed borderless mode for better quality of video and audio enabling desktop capture
- Set audio quality to 16 bits 44100 Hz under audio settings for your audio cards, lowering audio quality decrease use of bandwidth
- The audio level for your audio card recorded ingame shall be set to 100, you just have to adjust your level of earing with your screen or helmet
- It's simplest way and more optimized way than using OBS or Twitch Studio, you can find nice overlays to integrate as standalone programs, and it's more important to be concentrate on the content and the gameplay than fight with OBS or Twitch Studio
- Prefer to use Geforce Experience for record and stream videos instead of ffmpeg, because with bad settings it destroy a little your PC
- Capturing with GeForce Experience for uploading on Youtube need to set parameters as following:
Game with best graphisms and highest resolution of your game screen, while not encounter lags, or better choosing native resolution but upscaling after capture with ffmpeg
720p, 30 FPS, 15 Mbits/s, or 1440p, 30 FPS, 30 MBits/s, or 4k, 30 FPS, 50 Mbits/s, with in game resolution, in video settings of Geforce
Allow capturing desktop if using webcam and if using WebcamOverlay in confidentiality settings of Geforce, but resolution of video will be the resolution of your monitor screen 
Disable game capture in Windows settings and restart your computer
To embed a video in Html5 video tag instead of using Youtube iframe, I advice you to rezise video with bitrate using cmd command "ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 6M output.mp4", because video tag aren't compressing video like Youtube is doing and so low connexion can't watch your video
It's made for avoid loss of video quality while uploading on Youtube, and not having low resolution badly compressed by Youtube, so you can use the cmd command "ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=3840:2160:flags=neighbor -b:v 15M output.mp4" for transforming to 4k your video before uploading on Youtube, but you must recalculate the resolution ratio to fit original resolution ratio of your video, with a cruce product
- With ffmpeg you can paste several videos one after the others
Make input.txt containing the following:
	file 'input1.mp4'
	file 'input2.mp4'
	file 'input3.mp4'
Concatenate:
	ffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4
- With ffmpeg you can crop in time a video without the need of an encoder useless for this purpose
ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mp4
