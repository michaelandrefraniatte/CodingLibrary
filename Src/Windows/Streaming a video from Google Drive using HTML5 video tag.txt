The Google Drive API allows you to upload and download to your Google Drive from the server-side of your web applications and even through command line and desktop applications. There is Python and .NET support and extensive documentation on how to setup your projects.

Enable Google Drive API. Make sure you are signed into the Google account you wish to stream files from. You can visit this link to enable the Google Drive API.
Get an API key. By visiting this link, you can generate an API key to access Google Drive. You may be prompted to create a new project.
Get the file ID. Access Google Drive and find the file you wish to stream. Ensure it is available to the public. Open it in a new tab and copy the file ID. It should like something like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/<YOUR_FILE_ID>/view
Call the download link. Your download link should be in this format:
https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/<YOUR_FILE_ID>?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&alt=media

This was tested using a 200MB file. The download worked perfectly without any virus scanning interrupting it. Use the above link and add it to the embed code of your site.
