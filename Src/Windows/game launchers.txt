- I advice to use Steam only for playing different games on PC, and to not buy EA games and Ubisoft games asking to use respectively Origin and Uplay, also to not use Epic Games Launcher breaking Nintendo and Playstation controllers, even if Epic is giving free games, all these platforms other than Steam are breaking your PC
- Don't care about people who spend 2000 euros for just playing multiplayer games using crappy device/script/macro/program/cheat, they don't share or sharing only shit, but showing too much in video and social network, it's made to crush you even more, it's stupidity incarnate, it's narcissistic psychopath, there are more of them than you think, it's not who you think, it's never a chess for them, because thay are blinded mind, and like to crush others
- Prefer spend in a brand new PC with your prefered settings well tested under your old PC, and play only your favorite multiplayer games, because other games are making your PC a garbage, and you will spend too much for these craps
- Your gaming PC can be tweaked with the recommandations I talked, but you need another PC like a laptop for working, and instead of spending your money on your gaming PC eaten by different garbage and elitist games, and you and your time eaten also by it, and garbage platforms and forums, choose a non-invasive platform and the official platform, for playing your favorite and competitive multiplayer games, be the best and fuck the rest, and keep in mind to know rewarding who deserve your money and time
- There's people showing their cake of shits and want you eat this like them, or don't want you eat this but eat this in front of you saying it's so good, so there's you believing it's good and you want this, and there's me with very good cakes but I can't eat it, because people robbed it to me, and there's other people yet, like me
- I don't recommand portable console because the screen is very tiny, and there isn't so much games compatible, also the holding in the hands isn't good, too heavy and not ergonomic, and also the lifetime of the battery for one charge is very short, it's more for kids
- There are people bad, noob, and lazzy who their talks and works mean nothing in front of their acts, they want do things but just steal it, unable to help anyone or having any compassion, just to destroy others harder, it's kind of people jealous instead of admirative, they can't love anyone or anything, even if they try, their acts mean everything
- I don't advice to buy external drives, even self-powered, because it's very expensive and fragile, only download games you will play in near future under your PC drives and using Steam platform only, prefer stock your personal files on USB drive keys and your dev files on Github or Gitlab, also you can transport on you a USB drive key very easy, not an external drive
- To not have a start/crash issue, quit/open battle.net until there's no more notification of game update, after game update
- Steam is using less ressources with the following shortcut arguments
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -tcp
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -console -nofriendsui -no-dwrite -nointro -nobigpicture -nofasthtml -nocrashmonitor -noshaders -no-shared-textures -disablehighdpi -cef-single-process -cef-in-process-gpu -single_core -cef-disable-d3d11 -cef-disable-sandbox -disable-winh264 -cef-force-32bit -no-cef-sandbox -vrdisable -cef-disable-breakpad
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" +open steam://open/minigameslist
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" +open steam://open/largegameslist
- Epic Games Launcher and Steam steals all your private information and break your controller and PC and screen, it's hack fest with it, trust only in Xbox live and Battle.net on PC
- If you want to play Call of Duty, buy it on Battle.net, and never install Steam, because hacks and cheats of hackers and cheaters are insane on Steam, it's a back door open to hackers and cheaters in order to destroy your gaming experiences, even in solo campaign of your games
