- You can't grind anymore achievements while playing offline with Steam, and even back online the achievements aren't unlocked for lot of games, Steam Deck and other portable consoles are such useless for playing with Steam being in holidays or vacation or transport, and also it's not competitive with the majority of games too hard, it call to suicide while playing in bed or living room at home, the only things you can do with it, and you can't play while charging it, it's not made for long session, and it break very easily and fastly, prefer enjoy what you already have, and what you do
- The screens of portable consoles are too much tiny, it's for kids, and it sick your eyes
- You can't stream or record your games easy with portable consoles
- It uses Wi-Fi, and so the streaming is very bad with portable consoles
- It's not easy to use third party tools like for using any controller with portable consoles
- The PS5 Portal is not expensive for the hardwares it wearing and is a custom cloud service not expensive at all but it stay a console ecosystem
- Console ecosystems and game launchers on PC excepting Steam platform on PC are for milking cows because it's not retrocompatible, at each iteration of console you lost all your games, it's expensive, and there are no forums, nor interesting farm of achievements, nor customization of profile, it's never too late to use Steam and buy a nice gaming PC and nice games on Steam, a PC run more longer in time than consoles with best graphisms with best optimization, everything better, and it's the best media center, concerning Windows OS, you can do everything more easy, like capturing gameplays, streaming, discuss with friends, using some third party tools, using open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software like arduino, programing, sharing, remote playing, setting servers, setting domotics, ... (feel free to imagine everything more you can do with a PC)
- Subscribtion like gamepass, PS plus, and other subscribtions for online services are not good because you have nothing, you even not have time to play the games or the films, before it's removed, the time let for using the contents is short, if it's removed you have lost your money, while if you own the contents, your money is never lost, investing in something is owning something, with subscribtions you own nothing, only a catalogue
- It may be possible that playing on consoles and using subscribtion to play video games is not loving video games because you don't own the video games, you don't keep tracks of it, it's more like a mode effect like players in mass are playing and saying to love same weird video games, like Youtubers in mass are making same videos without making any more research, and so it don't deserve anything, it's like a lack of personality, and also why playing on consoles while the controls and the gameplays are very weirds, asking myself, it's simply unbelievable, too much players believing to love and to know games, but it's like music, there are too much commercial games and not immerssive at all, even journalists, or searchers, or programers, for it's their job all life, but have no affect, nor sensitivity, nor passionnate, nor skill on what they doing, even if they are well recognized and well paid for their jobs, but they are just noobs
- Some addicts of multiplayer games believe to be gamers, gaming lovers, and to love games, but the majority are cheaters, and it does not spare the streamers and youtubers, more the contrary, even if they use closed system like consoles
- With Steam on PC, it's easy to redeem games, if it don't run or your are deceived, it just need you don't play more than 2 hours and ask redeem before 15 days after the bought
- With Steam on PC, it's free for playing online, games are less expensive than on consoles, and games are always running even if you buy a new PC, it's because there are less players on PC who are milking cows 
- With Steam on PC, you can follow Steam guides while playing
- Consoles should be reserved to kids, who will not be ruined by playing only few games, and who don't know to manage a PC because they don't need it for working
- I advice to use Steam only for playing different games on PC, and to not buy EA games and Ubisoft games asking to use respectively Origin and Uplay, also to not use Epic Games Launcher breaking Nintendo and Playstation controllers, even if Epic is giving free games, all these platforms other than Steam are breaking your PC
- Don't care about people who spend 2000 euros for just playing multiplayer games using crappy device/script/macro/program/cheat, they don't share or sharing only shit, but showing too much in video and social network, it's made to crush you even more, it's stupidity incarnate, it's narcissistic psychopath, there are more of them than you think, it's not who you think, it's never a chess for them, because thay are blinded mind, and like to crush others
- Prefer spend in a brand new PC with your prefered settings well tested under your old PC, and play only your favorite multiplayer games, because other games are making your PC a garbage, and you will spend too much for these craps
- Your gaming PC can be tweaked with the recommandations I talked, but you need another PC like a laptop for working, and instead of spending your money on your gaming PC eaten by different garbage and elitist games, and you and your time eaten also by it, and garbage platforms and forums, choose a non-invasive platform and the official platform, for playing your favorite and competitive multiplayer games, be the best and fuck the rest, and keep in mind to know rewarding who deserve your money and time
- There's people showing their cake of shits and want you eat this like them, or don't want you eat this but eat this in front of you saying it's so good, so there's you believing it's good and you want this, and there's me with very good cakes but I can't eat it, because people robbed it to me, and there's other people yet, like me
- I don't recommand portable console because the screen is very tiny, and there isn't so much games compatible, also the holding in the hands isn't good, too heavy and not ergonomic, and also the lifetime of the battery for one charge is very short, it's more for kids
- There are people bad, noob, and lazzy who their talks and works mean nothing in front of their acts, they want do things but just steal it, unable to help anyone or having any compassion, just to destroy others harder, it's kind of people jealous instead of admirative, they can't love anyone or anything, even if they try, their acts mean everything
- I don't advice to buy external drives, even self-powered, because it's very expensive and fragile, only download games you will play in near future under your PC drives and using Steam platform only, prefer stock your personal files on USB drive keys and your dev files on Github or Gitlab, also you can transport on you a USB drive key very easy, not an external drive
- To not have a start/crash issue, quit/open battle.net until there's no more notification of game update, after game update
- Steam is using less ressources with the following shortcut arguments
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -tcp
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -console -nofriendsui -no-dwrite -nointro -nobigpicture -nofasthtml -nocrashmonitor -noshaders -no-shared-textures -disablehighdpi -cef-single-process -cef-in-process-gpu -single_core -cef-disable-d3d11 -cef-disable-sandbox -disable-winh264 -cef-force-32bit -no-cef-sandbox -vrdisable -cef-disable-breakpad
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" +open steam://open/minigameslist
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" +open steam://open/largegameslist
- Epic Games Launcher and Steam steals all your private information and break your controller and PC and screen, it's hack fest with it, trust only in Xbox live and Battle.net on PC
- If you want to play Call of Duty, buy it on Battle.net, and never install Steam, because hacks and cheats of hackers and cheaters are insane on Steam, it's a back door open to hackers and cheaters in order to destroy your gaming experiences, even in solo campaign of your games
- You can make coexist Steam and Battle.net, but take care to Epic and EA and Ubisoft platforms, they have no competitive games and it's rip off compare to Steam, use Battle.net while the weather with cheaters is calm down, and use Steam to play solo games
