- Subscribtion like gamepass, PS plus, and other subscribtions for online services are not good because you have nothing, you even not have time to play the games or the films, before it's removed, the time let for using the contents is short, if it's removed you have lost your money, while if you own the contents, your money is never lost, investing in something is owning something, with subscribtions you own nothing, only a catalogue
