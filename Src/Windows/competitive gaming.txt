- A game shall be made to make peace in you, to unstress, not raging... Only lazzy people without a job and without a life have time to play managing games, hard games, nolife games, asking to remember every mechanics, lot of games are made like this, like if it's for Youtubers with their channels centered in video gaming
- Call of Duty, like all popular competitive multiplayer games, give you want vomit everywhere, it's a buisness to sale hacks and cheats, and developers of these games are not the best policemans, removing all criminals before they commit crimes, even if they can, and also players don't see now, after hackers humanized their cheats, who is cheating to report he or she, only old players can recognize that it's impossible to aim down sight only 50 ms, and can see after becoming a cat, they are only a mouse now, cheaters running after them like they are purchased with their smell, and killed with half of a bullet of a SMG by only cheaters everywhere, and everytime of course, welcome in Call of Duty mad world, this ship of fools well real, cheaters are so noobs that they need to profit a little, and nobody can do without a double income if they can do, a lot of people have no passion of course, maybe only porn like Call of Duty
- The only resolution to not always fight against cheaters invading every games, every matches, everytimes, is to not play multiplayer matches, because hackers are strongest, there's nothing to do against these anti-players, I tried 10 years finding everything to do, but the only things to benefit is the optimization of a PC for better performance and durability explained a bit everywhere here, use only Steam for playing solo games and grind some achievements and friends, use firewallsteam.wfw to keep your PC a little safe moreover, and don't be concerned by security settings I'm talking about above, because it's a little harder and annoying like cheaters in multiplayer games, it's better to fight some bosses than cheaters I think, you will enjoy so much more, or not spending lot of money and time for raging even more
- Anti-cheat of Call of Duty, known under the name of Ricochet (or more Rick Hochet), use mitigations as devs call it, for make appearing a clone of player, in order aimbot target the clone, not the player, or for make disappearing a player, I think devs give another tool to hackers of cheats and server renters, in order to annoy more fair players, in fact devs are saying it detect cheaters and ban them, but not at all, it give also another tools to hackers to ban good players and to make more humanized cheats, the number of cheaters is always increasing like the number of cheats, comparing to other games, the franchise is more and more ridiculous, like buying and playing it, devs even not tried to enable natively ASLR, in order to disable the ability to cheat
- Call of Duty games destroy your PC like node isolation disabling, Windows update broken, IP leak, hacking exploit, hackers remote access, ..., because of hacked lobbies as seen with perfmon.exe (ressource monitor under the tab network where IP of servers connected are such stranges)
- A competitive gamer lowers graphic and audio settings under game options, plays multplayer games with his favorite playing controller device mounted to highest levels, uses the dedicated platforms, like Battle.net for CoD, Origins or EA app for Apex and Battlefield, Epic Game Launcher for Fortnite, and doesn't need to use a unlegit device to drag console players on their own consoles using aim assist abuse or other kinds of glitch or cheat, but he tweaks his PC, and he uses the most simple and adapted programs
- Don't play of your life any Call of Duty, each year only matches with only cheaters aimboting and wallhacking if you are strong, it's the reality well real, it's even worst with the anti-cheat called Ricochet, even if there are 36000 solutions for devs to they deny cheaters to cheat, like killing cheat process, or write to memory to annoy cheaters, or enable ASLR, or temp ban, or name and shame, or lawsuits, or repair bugs, or coding better, or alternate half time easy/hard matches, or server cloak, or timer clock left for cheater close hacks, or leaking CPU, or scary jump them, or bug their PC, bug their gaming platform application, advertise cheat detection process, kick ass with missiles in matches, forbide to play with friends because they tasking as boosters, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., even more than 36000 because it can be a virtual mirror of what can happening in real life
- I know four ways for cheaters to cheat, using screenshots or a webcam with image analysis or eyes tracking to autoshoot ennemies, using a device like Wiimote with high sensitivity for trigger aim assist abuse, using a game file modification, and using a third party program to read/write process memory
- Don't play fortnite and battlefield, cheater, tryhard, nolife, fury, bitch, for every tastes and ages, you hence can be blind for life, really, it's not a joke
- When too much services and programs are running, in multiplayer games your ping is more high than usual, your PC is under good performances, and the games are running like unoptimized and bugs can appearing, so in 90% of cases it's user faults, not developpers of games faults, you can ear loud all the cry babies on Steam community, insulting everytime everywhere, but take care they can balance it on you
- CoD devs doesn't like cheaters and you are a cheater, being forwarded against them, if you are using some kind of things giving you some unfair advantages
