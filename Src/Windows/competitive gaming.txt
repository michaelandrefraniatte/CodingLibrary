- A game shall be made to make peace in you, to unstress, not raging... Only lazzy people without a job and without a life have time to play managing games, hard games, nolife games, asking to remember every mechanics, lot of games are made like this, like if it's for Youtubers with their channels centered in video gaming
- Call of Duty, like all popular competitive multiplayer games, give you want vomit everywhere everytime, such there are only tryhards and cheaters, it's a buisness to sale hacks and cheats, and developers of these games are not the best policemans, removing all criminals before they commit crimes, even if they can, they are more criminals pushing players in the hands of hackers and cheaters, and also players don't see now, after hackers humanized their cheats, who is cheating to report he or she, only old players can recognize that it's impossible to aim down sight only 50 ms, and can see after becoming a cat, they are only a mouse now, cheaters running after them like they are purchased with their smell, and killed with half of a bullet of a SMG by only cheaters everywhere, and everytime of course, welcome in Call of Duty mad world, this ship of fools well real, cheaters are so noobs that they need to profit a little, and nobody can do without a double income if they can do, a lot of people have no passion of course, maybe only porn like Call of Duty
- The only resolution to not always fight against cheaters invading every games, every matches, everytimes, is to not play multiplayer matches, because hackers are strongest, there's nothing to do against these anti-players, I tried 10 years finding everything to do, but the only things to benefit is the optimization of a PC for better performance and durability explained a bit everywhere here, use only Steam for playing solo games and grind some achievements and friends, use firewallsteam.wfw to keep your PC a little safe moreover, and don't be concerned by security settings I'm talking about above, because it's a little harder and annoying like cheaters in multiplayer games, it's better to fight some bosses than cheaters I think, you will enjoy so much more, or not spending lot of money and time for raging even more
- Anti-cheat of Call of Duty, known under the name of Ricochet (or more Rick Hochet), use mitigations as devs call it, for make appearing a clone of player, in order aimbot target the clone, not the player, or for make disappearing a player, I think devs give another tool to hackers of cheats and server renters, in order to annoy more fair players, in fact devs are saying it detect cheaters and ban them, but not at all, it give also another tools to hackers to ban good players and to make more humanized cheats, the number of cheaters is always increasing like the number of cheats, comparing to other games, the franchise is more and more ridiculous, like buying and playing it, devs even not tried to enable natively ASLR, in order to disable the ability to cheat
- Call of Duty games destroy your PC like node isolation disabling, Windows update broken, IP leak, hacking exploit, hackers remote access, ..., because of hacked lobbies as seen with perfmon.exe (ressource monitor under the tab network where IP of servers connected are such stranges)
- A competitive gamer lowers graphic and audio settings under game options, plays multplayer games with his favorite playing controller device mounted to highest levels, uses the dedicated platforms, like Battle.net for CoD, Origins or EA app for Apex and Battlefield, Epic Game Launcher for Fortnite, and doesn't need to use a unlegit device to drag console players on their own consoles using aim assist abuse or other kinds of glitch or cheat, but he tweaks his PC, and he uses the most simple and adapted programs
- Don't play of your life any Call of Duty, each year only matches with only cheaters aimboting and wallhacking if you are strong, it's the reality well real, it's even worst with the anti-cheat called Ricochet, even if there are 36000 solutions for devs to they deny cheaters to cheat, like killing cheat process, or write to memory to annoy cheaters, or enable ASLR, or temp ban, or name and shame, or lawsuits, or repair bugs, or coding better, or alternate half time easy/hard matches, or server cloak, or timer clock left for cheater close hacks, or leaking CPU, or scary jump them, or bug their PC, bug their gaming platform application, advertise cheat detection process, kick ass with missiles in matches, forbide to play with friends because they tasking as boosters, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., even more than 36000 because it can be a virtual mirror of what can happening in real life
- I know four ways for cheaters to cheat, using screenshots or a webcam with image analysis or eyes tracking to autoshoot ennemies, using a device like Wiimote with high sensitivity for trigger aim assist abuse, using a game file modification, and using a third party program to read/write process memory
- Don't play fortnite and battlefield, cheater, tryhard, nolife, fury, bitch, for every tastes and ages, you hence can be blind for life, really, it's not a joke
- When too much services and programs are running, in multiplayer games your ping is more high than usual, your PC is under good performances, and the games are running like unoptimized and bugs can appearing, so in 90% of cases it's user faults, not developpers of games faults, you can ear loud all the cry babies on Steam community, insulting everytime everywhere, but take care they can balance it on you
- CoD devs doesn't like cheaters and you are a cheater, being forwarded against them, if you are using some kind of things giving you some unfair advantages
- There are viruses in all Call of Duty games of the franchise, just if you enable Windows Defender to highest level, not only in diagnosis mode, the game won't start, and you are forced to disable the security, that let you be to restore your PC from factory, for enable again the diagnosis mode or Windows defender to highest level, while all other games start
- It's so trash that it eat all your energy of a day just to play one match with cheaters or not even one
- Devs don't want to enable Adress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), so they don't care about the community around their games
- The gameplay is horrible, aiming is like moving a pen in a poop, and firing is like pushing in, but players are loving it for it, they like to play like this apparently
- It's easy to recognize it's only cheaters, when there is an update it's playable 1 day with only big tard noobs running in front of you, but after it's unplayable
- The servers are own by hackers opening servers in all other games not legit
- Even if the franchise is own by Microsoft now, nothing can change, it will be even worst because the whole community around the games of the franchise are only noob cheaters, and they want for their money
- It asking to buy a new PC each year with the new game, you breaking a little more each time you playing, sometimes worst than other times
- The games are anti third tool controller support not allowing to use k/m and gamepad at same time, and it's not to avoid aimboting, it would only support newest xinput controllers, it would be the same, very soon, but in fact xinput handle is the same for all generations of xinput controllers, it wouldn't surprise me, it block from the generation name as simple as that, finding another excuse, like the games ask better control for less aim assist, and k/m players raging less for it, complaining too much actually against console players using aim assist
- Playing the game drive you crazy, and you will make very bad things in your life you will regret later
- Games of the franchise are made for pigeons that will buy cheats, and wait to be banned in the games, for buy again all their stuffs and the games, it's made for feed in loop developpers, editors and hackers, laughing in front of the player faces, it's like this since the first game of the franchise, nothing will change, it's an economy, that Sony and Microsoft have coveted, unfortunatly Microsoft have put most of money, and own now the franchise, it come odd with the poor PC they sale, bugged and unoptimized as fuck
- Now all the cheaters using keyboard and mouse, emulate a controller, like a legit aimbot behind aim assist, hidding it like this
- 80% of people are cheating in the games of the franchise, nothing is and can be done to get rid of cheaters, even if it's possible, the cheats are the lungs of the games
- When you are good and don't need any cheat you can't be shadow banned or banned, but you always loose, play in a team of only noobs, being always first of your team, and enjoy a match without cheaters 1 on 10, but it's not enough for a competitive gamer
- Cheaters are in far worst number the week-end, the games of the franchise don't deserve any interest
- If you play Call of Duty, you are forced to buy a new PC each time you want to play the new one, because it's poorly optimized, and not competitive at all
- As all the servers are own by gameservers/clanservers, no more Blizzard servers, that open servers on consoles and PC games not legit, with hacks and game cracks, the entire games and the future games of the franchise Call of Duty, are pissing on players, and let hackers and cheaters free to destroy them, mentally and physically by destroying their PC and their integrity
- I never seen any game of the franchise Call of Duty without fill by cheaters, incoming in almost all matches, almost filling entire places in adversory team
- Developpers of the franchise Call of Duty sale cheats to cheaters and data of players, and incorporate in their games the ability to hack players, it can't be different, even if they try to make believe it's not, the entire buisness of the franchise is based on it, Microsoft will continue and not stop this, otherwise they will have surprise the game not earn so much as they thinking buying it at a price very expensive
- I tried everything to find good servers IP to play on and secure/optimize my PC to highest levels, but there's nothing to do against cheaters, only hacking like flooding memory but it's not tolerate because it annoy cheaters
- The best thing to do is to not give meat to cheaters, to let them together, faggots are they, if you are a fair player don't play any multiplayer games, there is an algorithm for cheaters to finish always first and win all matches, not for fair and good players, destroyed everytime by these cheaters and loosing all their matches they try to win and even play, but it's unplayable because of cheaters everytime and everywhere
- Flooding virtual memory for cheaters can't access it isn't running against cheaters because devs are creating cheat game built of their games
- There are cheats that hackers can't create by just writting and reading in process memory, it's game builts with cheats
- There are cheats on consoles, it can be only created with the consent of game developpers
- Not banning hackers using cheat engine or any reverse engineering tool easy to detect by anti-cheat allow to hackers making cheats easy, so it's a consent between cheaters, hackers, and game developpers
- Cheating programs are made easy and fast by hackers because game developpers consent to that
- Cheat like aimbot is more and more humanized but more and more destructive paradoxally, because it's a business wanted by game developpers for cheaters, they win more money with it than with their games
- There was cheats with read/write process memory easy to detect with reverse engineering but not banned by CoD devs, then they developped built in cheats in game exe for their organized competition like wallhack, but now they deliver their cheats built in games with more and more cheats and bugged, meanwhile they developping remote PC cheats with memory execution with string reflection, and now they integrating AI (Artificial Intelligence) for developping cheats lonely while ASLR is enable, and for all mutiplayer games, cheats can run in expansion packages with obfuscation, while the program integrating it is heavy, it's impossible to incoroprate analysis so much there are data to analyse and even anti-cheats integrating player statistics, it stay too much data, and very confusing 
- Why cheaters can be invisible while you are sure to aim and fire them, they kill you, and in the killcam, they are where you was aiming... Ricochet mitigation? But it's not me the cheater... Also your aim when you fire the cheater is like you are fired but the cheater fire only after... I've also killed a cheater, it was display his name, but he continued alive and killed me... A god mode don't display the kill... All of These are new, and it can only come with a cheat binary game built by devs
- I think Call of Duty devs are creating cheats for all other multiplayer games that they don't own, using the ways I exposed just above, and with all their knowledges of mitigations while doing Ricochet where kernel is their hacker new arms, and their games are a sandbox, beware of them, they almost created the world war III with sharpness of all the atrocities coming with
- The game is crashing for PC players with certain Ryzen CPU because these certain CPU are integrating a security for online games that annoy devs and hackers avoiding to cheat on owner of these certain CPU
- It ban a cheater so slowly that he can afford a new game with a new account and add friends again, a real cheat buisness
