- A game shall be made to make peace in you, to unstress, not raging... Only lazzy people without a job and without a life have time to play managing games, hard games, nolife games, asking to remember every mechanics, lot of games are made like this, like if it's for Youtubers with their channels centered in video gaming
- Call of Duty, like all popular competitive multiplayer games, give you want vomit everywhere everytime, such there are only tryhards and cheaters, it's a buisness to sale hacks and cheats, and developers of these games are not the best policemans, removing all criminals before they commit crimes, even if they can, they are more criminals pushing players in the hands of hackers and cheaters, and also players don't see now, after hackers humanized their cheats, who is cheating to report he or she, only old players can recognize that it's impossible to aim down sight only 50 ms, and can see after becoming a cat, they are only a mouse now, cheaters running after them like they are purchased with their smell, and killed with half of a bullet of a SMG by only cheaters everywhere, and everytime of course, welcome in Call of Duty mad world, this ship of fools well real, cheaters are so noobs that they need to profit a little, and nobody can do without a double income if they can do, a lot of people have no passion of course, maybe only porn like Call of Duty
- The only resolution to not always fight against cheaters invading every games, every matches, everytimes, is to not play multiplayer matches, because hackers are strongest, there's nothing to do against these anti-players, I tried 10 years finding everything to do, but the only things to benefit is the optimization of a PC for better performance and durability explained a bit everywhere here, use only Steam for playing solo games and grind some achievements and friends, use firewallsteam.wfw to keep your PC a little safe moreover, and don't be concerned by security settings I'm talking about above, because it's a little harder and annoying like cheaters in multiplayer games, it's better to fight some bosses than cheaters I think, you will enjoy so much more, or not spending lot of money and time for raging even more
- Anti-cheat of Call of Duty, known under the name of Ricochet (or more Rick Hochet), use mitigations as devs call it, for make appearing a clone of player, in order aimbot target the clone, not the player, or for make disappearing a player, I think devs give another tool to hackers of cheats and server renters, in order to annoy more fair players, in fact devs are saying it detect cheaters and ban them, but not at all, it give also another tools to hackers to ban good players and to make more humanized cheats, the number of cheaters is always increasing like the number of cheats, comparing to other games, the franchise is more and more ridiculous, like buying and playing it, devs even not tried to enable natively ASLR, in order to disable the ability to cheat
- Call of Duty games destroy your PC like node isolation disabling, Windows update broken, IP leak, hacking exploit, hackers remote access, ..., because of hacked lobbies as seen with perfmon.exe (ressource monitor under the tab network where IP of servers connected are such stranges)
- A competitive gamer lowers graphic and audio settings under game options, plays multplayer games with his favorite playing controller device mounted to highest levels, uses the dedicated platforms, like Battle.net for CoD, Origins or EA app for Apex and Battlefield, Epic Game Launcher for Fortnite, and doesn't need to use a unlegit device to drag console players on their own consoles using aim assist abuse or other kinds of glitch or cheat, but he tweaks his PC, and he uses the most simple and adapted programs
- Don't play of your life any Call of Duty, each year only matches with only cheaters aimboting and wallhacking if you are strong, it's the reality well real, it's even worst with the anti-cheat called Ricochet, even if there are 36000 solutions for devs to they deny cheaters to cheat, like killing cheat process, or write to memory to annoy cheaters, or enable ASLR, or temp ban, or name and shame, or lawsuits, or repair bugs, or coding better, or alternate half time easy/hard matches, or server cloak, or timer clock left for cheater close hacks, or leaking CPU, or scary jump them, or bug their PC, bug their gaming platform application, advertise cheat detection process, kick ass with missiles in matches, forbide to play with friends because they tasking as boosters, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., even more than 36000 because it can be a virtual mirror of what can happening in real life
- I know four ways for cheaters to cheat, using screenshots or a webcam with image analysis or eyes tracking to autoshoot ennemies, using a device like Wiimote with high sensitivity for trigger aim assist abuse, using a game file modification, and using a third party program to read/write process memory
- Don't play fortnite and battlefield, cheater, tryhard, nolife, fury, bitch, for every tastes and ages, you hence can be blind for life, really, it's not a joke
- When too much services and programs are running, in multiplayer games your ping is more high than usual, your PC is under good performances, and the games are running like unoptimized and bugs can appearing, so in 90% of cases it's user faults, not developpers of games faults, you can ear loud all the cry babies on Steam community, insulting everytime everywhere, but take care they can balance it on you
- CoD devs doesn't like cheaters and you are a cheater, being forwarded against them, if you are using some kind of things giving you some unfair advantages
- There are viruses in all Call of Duty games of the franchise, just if you enable Windows Defender to highest level, not only in diagnosis mode, the game won't start, and you are forced to disable the security, that let you be to restore your PC from factory, for enable again the diagnosis mode or Windows defender to highest level, while all other games start
- It's so trash that it eat all your energy of a day just to play one match with cheaters or not even one
- Devs don't want to enable Adress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), so they don't care about the community around their games
- The gameplay is horrible, aiming is like moving a pen in a poop, and firing is like pushing in, but players are loving it for it, they like to play like this apparently
- It's easy to recognize it's only cheaters, when there is an update it's playable 1 day with only big tard noobs running in front of you, but after it's unplayable
- The servers are own by hackers opening servers in all other games not legit
- Even if the franchise is own by Microsoft now, nothing can change, it will be even worst because the whole community around the games of the franchise are only noob cheaters, and they want for their money
- It asking to buy a new PC each year with the new game, you breaking a little more each time you playing, sometimes worst than other times
- The games are anti third tool controller support not allowing to use k/m and gamepad at same time, and it's not to avoid aimboting, it would only support newest xinput controllers, it would be the same, very soon, but in fact xinput handle is the same for all generations of xinput controllers, it wouldn't surprise me, it block from the generation name as simple as that, finding another excuse, like the games ask better control for less aim assist, and k/m players raging less for it, complaining too much actually against console players using aim assist
- Playing the game drive you crazy, and you will make very bad things in your life you will regret later
- Games of the franchise are made for pigeons that will buy cheats, and wait to be banned in the games, for buy again all their stuffs and the games, it's made for feed in loop developpers, editors and hackers, laughing in front of the player faces, it's like this since the first game of the franchise, nothing will change, it's an economy, that Sony and Microsoft have coveted, unfortunatly Microsoft have put most of money, and own now the franchise, it come odd with the poor PC they sale, bugged and unoptimized as fuck
- Now all the cheaters using keyboard and mouse, emulate a controller, like a legit aimbot behind aim assist, hidding it like this
- 80% of people are cheating in the games of the franchise, nothing is and can be done to get rid of cheaters, even if it's possible, the cheats are the lungs of the games
- When you are good and don't need any cheat you can't be shadow banned or banned, but you always loose, play in a team of only noobs, being always first of your team, and enjoy a match without cheaters 1 on 10, but it's not enough for a competitive gamer
- Cheaters are in far worst number the week-end, the games of the franchise don't deserve any interest
- If you play Call of Duty, you are forced to buy a new PC each time you want to play the new one, because it's poorly optimized, and not competitive at all
- As all the servers are own by gameservers/clanservers, no more Blizzard servers, that open servers on consoles and PC games not legit, with hacks and game cracks, the entire games and the future games of the franchise Call of Duty, are pissing on players, and let hackers and cheaters free to destroy them, mentally and physically by destroying their PC and their integrity
- I never seen any game of the franchise Call of Duty without fill by cheaters, incoming in almost all matches, almost filling entire places in adversory team
- Developpers of the franchise Call of Duty sale cheats to cheaters and data of players, and incorporate in their games the ability to hack players, it can't be different, even if they try to make believe it's not, the entire buisness of the franchise is based on it, Microsoft will continue and not stop this, otherwise they will have surprise the game not earn so much as they thinking buying it at a price very expensive
- I tried everything to find good servers IP to play on and secure/optimize my PC to highest levels, but there's nothing to do against cheaters, only hacking like flooding memory but it's not tolerate because it annoy cheaters
- The best thing to do is to not give meat to cheaters, to let them together, faggots are they, if you are a fair player don't play any multiplayer games, there is an algorithm for cheaters to finish always first and win all matches, not for fair and good players, destroyed everytime by these cheaters and loosing all their matches they try to win and even play, but it's unplayable because of cheaters everytime and everywhere
- Flooding virtual memory for cheaters can't access it isn't running against cheaters because devs are creating cheat game built of their games
- There are cheats that hackers can't create by just writting and reading in process memory, it's game builts with cheats
- There are cheats on consoles, it can be only created with the consent of game developpers
- Not banning hackers using cheat engine or any reverse engineering tool easy to detect by anti-cheat allow to hackers making cheats easy, so it's a consent between cheaters, hackers, and game developpers
- Cheating programs are made easy and fast by hackers because game developpers consent to that
- Cheat like aimbot is more and more humanized but more and more destructive paradoxally, because it's a business wanted by game developpers for cheaters, they win more money with it than with their games
- There was cheats with read/write process memory easy to detect with reverse engineering but not banned by CoD devs, then they developped built in cheats in game exe for their organized competition like wallhack, but now they deliver their cheats built in games with more and more cheats and bugged, meanwhile they developping remote PC cheats with memory execution with string reflection, and now they integrating AI (Artificial Intelligence) for developping cheats lonely while ASLR is enable, and for all mutiplayer games, cheats can run in expansion packages with obfuscation, while the program integrating it is heavy, it's impossible to incoroprate analysis so much there are data to analyse and even anti-cheats integrating player statistics, it stay too much data, and very confusing 
- Why cheaters can be invisible while you are sure to aim and fire them, they kill you, and in the killcam, they are where you was aiming... Ricochet mitigation? But it's not me the cheater... Also your aim when you fire the cheater is like you are fired but the cheater fire only after... I've also killed a cheater, it was display his name, but he continued alive and killed me... A god mode don't display the kill... All of These are new, and it can only come with a cheat binary game built by devs
- I think Call of Duty devs are creating cheats for all other multiplayer games that they don't own, using the ways I exposed just above, and with all their knowledges of mitigations while doing Ricochet where kernel is their hacker new arms, and their games are a sandbox, beware of them, they almost created the world war III with sharpness of all the atrocities coming with
- The game is crashing for PC players with certain Ryzen CPU because these certain CPU are integrating a security for online games that annoy devs and hackers avoiding to cheat on owner of these certain CPU
- It ban a cheater so slowly that he can afford a new game with a new account and add friends again, a real cheat buisness
- They said there is 60% less cheaters than in other games, but where they know how many cheaters there are in other games, it's because they have statistics on how many cheat programs they selling in their games and other games
- They ban legit players in order these players come on forums to complain they are banned for making believe they ban cheaters
- They ban only players who did nothing wrong
- When you annoy too much cheaters rolling and winning against them, they have methods to forward you in hacked lobbies each time you want to play, you are a target for cheaters, I'm suspecting GMBH (Germany) and clanservers/gameservers (France) to open these hacked lobbies fill by very bad cheaters unstoppable
- I know someone using devices like Cronus and Titan, making strongly lock the ennemy even if he moves his aim, it's aim assist abuse hack, he was with it in all consoles (PS and Xbox) and in all Call of Duty, he never get banned
- When you are banned for no reason, because you did nothing wrong, you can prosecute in justice the company, for scam while you spent lot of money, by making a lawsuit, and win some money
- When you are killed, the killer can have a feature where you explode like a vomit, you see it in killcam but also when you are killed, it's far from respecting anyone
- When you shoot with RPG launcher and you are at 4 meters of a cheater, the cheater will jump above your rocket, you can be sure it's a cheater
- Call of Duty games are so land of hackers that some servers can be reached like it's routers behind, and also for all IP of authentications, and also you can't get hostnames from IP, there isn't any DNS registration, like it's ghost IP
- I searched IP of servers with less cheaters, there isn't any server with less cheaters, the matchmaking forward me cheaters in every matches and against all of them, even if I block ability to be joined by unknowns
- What I did for secure my PC and the game were running 1 day, flooding were running 2 days because they made their games built with cheats after, and seeing the state of their games, they are far more concentrate to deliver cheats and to hack players
- I always find a weapon in each Call of Duty game, I use it all the times, but they nerf it to maximum, not like other weapons, it become unplayable, unable to kill anyone
- Less cheaters, far more rage quits, noobs and weird campers
- The final killcam of a match isn't shown when it's a cheater which is killed in the killcam
- The forums on Steam are trash, full of crybabies insulting each others, few only complain about cheaters, it say a long on the community
- You can't grind anymore achievements while playing offline with Steam, and even back online the achievements aren't unlocked for lot of games, Steam Deck and other portable consoles are such useless for playing with Steam being in holidays or vacation or transport, and also it's not competitive with the majority of games too hard, it call to suicide while playing in bed or living room at home, the only things you can do with it, and you can't play while charging it, it's not made for long session, and it break very easily and fastly, prefer enjoy what you already have, and what you do
- The screens of portable consoles are too much tiny, it's for kids, and it sick your eyes
- You can't stream or record your games easy with portable consoles
- It uses Wi-Fi, and so the streaming is very bad with portable consoles
- It's not easy to use third party tools like for using any controller with portable consoles
- The PS5 Portal is not expensive for the hardwares it wearing and is a custom cloud service not expensive at all but it stay a console ecosystem
- Console ecosystems and game launchers on PC excepting Steam platform on PC are for milking cows because it's not retrocompatible, at each iteration of console you lost all your games, it's expensive, and there are no forums, nor interesting farm of achievements, nor customization of profile, it's never too late to use Steam and buy a nice gaming PC and nice games on Steam, a PC run more longer in time than consoles with best graphisms with best optimization, everything better, and it's the best media center, concerning Windows OS, you can do everything more easy, like capturing gameplays, streaming, discuss with friends, using some third party tools, using open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software like arduino, programing, sharing, remote playing, setting servers, setting domotics, ... (feel free to imagine everything more you can do with a PC)
- Subscribtion like gamepass, PS plus, and other subscribtions for online services are not good because you have nothing, you even not have time to play the games or the films, before it's removed, the time let for using the contents is short, if it's removed you have lost your money, while if you own the contents, your money is never lost, investing in something is owning something, with subscribtions you own nothing, only a catalogue
- It may be possible that playing on consoles and using subscribtion to play video games is not loving video games because you don't own the video games, you don't keep tracks of it, it's more like a mode effect like players in mass are playing and saying to love same weird video games, like Youtubers in mass are making same videos without making any more research, and so it don't deserve anything, it's like a lack of personality, and also why playing on consoles while the controls and the gameplays are very weirds, asking myself, it's simply unbelievable, too much players believing to love and to know games, but it's like music, there are too much commercial games and not immerssive at all, even journalists, or searchers, or programers, for it's their job all life, but have no affect, nor sensitivity, nor passionnate, nor skill on what they doing, even if they are well recognized and well paid for their jobs, but they are just noobs
- Some addicts of multiplayer games believe to be gamers, gaming lovers, and to love games, but the majority are cheaters, and it does not spare the streamers and youtubers, more the contrary, even if they use closed system like consoles
- With Steam on PC, it's easy to redeem games, if it don't run or your are deceived, it just need you don't play more than 2 hours and ask redeem before 15 days after the bought
- With Steam on PC, it's free for playing online, games are less expensive than on consoles, and games are always running even if you buy a new PC, it's because there are less players on PC who are milking cows 
- With Steam on PC, you can follow Steam guides while playing
- Consoles should be reserved to kids, who will not be ruined by playing only few games, and who don't know to manage a PC because they don't need it for working
- I advice to use Steam only for playing different games on PC, and to not buy EA games and Ubisoft games asking to use respectively Origin and Uplay, also to not use Epic Games Launcher breaking Nintendo and Playstation controllers, even if Epic is giving free games, all these platforms other than Steam are breaking your PC
- Don't care about people who spend 2000 euros for just playing multiplayer games using crappy device/script/macro/program/cheat, they don't share or sharing only shit, but showing too much in video and social network, it's made to crush you even more, it's stupidity incarnate, it's narcissistic psychopath, there are more of them than you think, it's not who you think, it's never a chess for them, because thay are blinded mind, and like to crush others
- Prefer spend in a brand new PC with your prefered settings well tested under your old PC, and play only your favorite multiplayer games, because other games are making your PC a garbage, and you will spend too much for these craps
- Your gaming PC can be tweaked with the recommandations I talked, but you need another PC like a laptop for working, and instead of spending your money on your gaming PC eaten by different garbage and elitist games, and you and your time eaten also by it, and garbage platforms and forums, choose a non-invasive platform and the official platform, for playing your favorite and competitive multiplayer games, be the best and fuck the rest, and keep in mind to know rewarding who deserve your money and time
- There's people showing their cake of shits and want you eat this like them, or don't want you eat this but eat this in front of you saying it's so good, so there's you believing it's good and you want this, and there's me with very good cakes but I can't eat it, because people robbed it to me, and there's other people yet, like me
- I don't recommand portable console because the screen is very tiny, and there isn't so much games compatible, also the holding in the hands isn't good, too heavy and not ergonomic, and also the lifetime of the battery for one charge is very short, it's more for kids
- There are people bad, noob, and lazzy who their talks and works mean nothing in front of their acts, they want do things but just steal it, unable to help anyone or having any compassion, just to destroy others harder, it's kind of people jealous instead of admirative, they can't love anyone or anything, even if they try, their acts mean everything
- I don't advice to buy external drives, even self-powered, because it's very expensive and fragile, only download games you will play in near future under your PC drives and using Steam platform only, prefer stock your personal files on USB drive keys and your dev files on Github or Gitlab, also you can transport on you a USB drive key very easy, not an external drive
- To not have a start/crash issue, quit/open battle.net until there's no more notification of game update, after game update
- Steam is using less ressources with the following shortcut arguments
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -tcp
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -console -nofriendsui -no-dwrite -nointro -nobigpicture -nofasthtml -nocrashmonitor -noshaders -no-shared-textures -disablehighdpi -cef-single-process -cef-in-process-gpu -single_core -cef-disable-d3d11 -cef-disable-sandbox -disable-winh264 -cef-force-32bit -no-cef-sandbox -vrdisable -cef-disable-breakpad
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" +open steam://open/minigameslist
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" +open steam://open/largegameslist
- Epic Games Launcher and Steam steals all your private information and break your controller and PC and screen, it's hack fest with it, trust only in Xbox live and Battle.net on PC
- If you want to play Call of Duty, buy it on Battle.net, and never install Steam, because hacks and cheats of hackers and cheaters are insane on Steam, it's a back door open to hackers and cheaters in order to destroy your gaming experiences, even in solo campaign of your games
- You can make coexist Steam and Battle.net, but take care to Epic and EA and Ubisoft platforms, they have no competitive games and it's rip off compare to Steam, use Battle.net while the weather with cheaters is calm down, and use Steam to play solo games
- You can't feel the gameplay and the pleasure to aim in a FPS, with a stick of a gamepad or a strong sensitivity, cause of the too short step of the run to aim
- I do not recommand to spend money in virtual reality because of the following reasons
The helmet is heavy to wear, and moving with is really uncomfortable
The opticals are low field of view and low resolution, just a screen in front of your eyes with no peripheral vision
There's no accessories like a gun, a arch, a racing steering wheel, a moto straffing, there's only a splitted gamepad
The game engines and games are not coded and imagined specially for be used with it, it's just tweak of motion inputs, and special screen outputs, no more
- When you having a new PC for gaming, it's full of weird and useless programs that not have to be keept
- On Steam, the community is toxic, when you help someone, the majority of time the someone never reply, taking you under him, he watches you from above, even if you helped him
- The biggest library is on PC, which will always growing, and the minimum configuration for running games is stabilizing in time, it's like phone no more evolving in terms of thechnologies and components no more able to be miniaturized
- The game settings under game options for gamepad or mouse are very important, like settings for deadzone, acceleration, sensitivity, ...
- When a program is connecting bluetooth controller, it can not run, because sometimes connection bugs, so it needs to connect/disconnect manually from perpherals and printers under control panel
- For better performances, keep enable the service SysMain, and disable all bluetooth services but not the service bluetooth peripheral manager, for reduce input lag of your wireless controllers
- Take care to have your controllers always batteries well charged, for minimum input lag and minimum drifting
- If the game launcher you are using is faking also a controller you want to use in a game it fake, be sure to close the game launcher after starting a game, and use a controller when game is started
- Use Devreorder to reorder your prefered controller to be used prioritarly in your games or to hide some controller for disable unwanted controls
- If you are using a virtual Xbox Controller, prefer to add manually the driver for it, install manually the driver as a driver for old generation device, choosing on disk with file .inf, from peripheral manager under control panel, it's in the tab system peipherals
- Only official Nintendo joycons and official Playstation controllers have data in joy.cpl (Win + R) for be used to simulate Keyboard and Mouse or Xbox Controller
- When you need a cable for your controllers, you need cable allowing synchronisation (data) and power, often cable only allow power, but it needs both
- Press Win + R and type joy.cpl, then press enter, for testing your controller properties
- For gyro aiming, Switch Pro Controller is better than PS5 DualSense controller because the gyro of this last isn't a real gyro, it's more a relative accelerometer, more cheap than a true gyro, like the one of Switch Pro Controller, very good
- If you aren't dirty, but clean and cautious, and you meet stick drift or input delay of your controllers, your PC is targetted by remote attacks, or the software you are using for enable your controllers in games is trash, maybe both why not
- Steam is using lot of CPU, GPU and RAM for nothing and weird things like Steam Inputs not allowing to play the way you want with the controller you want, like lot of games, but lot of games are fun to play if you still are a kid, despite it's fun, it's very expensive and time eater, the only way to play the way you want, is to create a controller, or play only few games with an infinite lifetime
- The native support of controllers in PC games, not native controllers known as keyboard/mouse and Xbox controller, is a very bad idea, because it result in low optimization of games and low or bugged or not running handle of controllers like with DirectInput controllers or Dualsense, also it's not in favor of some developpers who want practice on controller support, and it's a time consumer for game developpers
- Controllers with haptic feedbacks (i.e. HD rumbles) and adaptative triggers are cheap sex toys, it don't add immerssive gameplay to games, the immerssion come from what reflect more the reality, not from what is cheap or bad or for cheating
- Everybody are using naturally rechargeable batteries in their controllers, but why using a Wii or candles for just task as a sensor bar for Wiimote IR cam, instead of a USB one, no I don't for my part obviously, everybody are so genious, without taking account a Wii or candles can burn your setup, it already burn lot of energy uselessly
- If you want playing with motion controllers, choose PC, instead of consoles, because for PC you can play like you want at more than 90% of games, but for consoles, it's less than 10%... believe me I'm an expert in motion controls, a professionnal in programing, a hardcore gamer, and a nice game lover
- To avoid input lag of Joycon left, connect it after Joycon right, and vice versa, and also run the program for using it, with administrative privilege and compatibility mode of Windows Vista, and the version x86
- It's easy to detect if a Wii Sensor Bar is working, just check with a camera if you see leds lighting
- It must have nothing under and above sensor bar for using a IR cam in front of leds
- Wii U USB sensor bar must not be wired in a always alimented USB port of your PC
- You can use August LP310 Remote used normaly for Power Point presentation for Top Down Shooters
- For certain joycons like from freaks and geeks, you need to let pressed sync button until led blinking start to slow down and also you need to allow connection by clicking on Windows notification to connect it
- You can't enjoy a 4 K / 200 Hz monitor if you don't have a 8000 DPI / 400 Hz mouse
- Disable Steam Input under properties of the game from Steam if you have your game or a program taking the control enabling your controller
- Each time you unplug your controller, the game switch automatically to keyboard and mouse when you starting it, so it need to enable again your controller in game options if you plug your controller
- Don't be empty mind, learn from ashes, it's easy to understand with practice and make running things if not lazzy, the issue is between chair and keyboard and mouse, in most cases the user is the fault, not questionning himself enough, not listening principles already explained to him, and letting himself without any response
- Your controller can support several handle, but it's not a reason to believe it's bugged, only accept one handle, the one you choose to play with, don't be an idiot, choose the right manner to play with your controller, choose the right controller with the right control, find your best confort and adapt yourself to use it correctly, use the best with your best
- When you have several controllers on your PC but want to use a specific one, you need to unplug the controllers you don't want to use and restart your PC
- A good game shall have a level design, a immerssive visual, a feeling controller in hand, a audio and video with quality features, a gameplay loop, a freedom in walking and action, a visible progress, not too hard, giving a pleasure and unstress
- SteamInput can't be totally disable, because it's bugged and badly coded, like with Dualshock4 controller simulating a Xbox controller with third party tool, but without any reason making a fake keyboard/mouse, while Dualsense controller don't do this
- The only way to be peacy with the wanted manner to play games is to create a own controller using Arduino or find a adapted controller
- Consoles were always under PC in terms of graphics, materials to use like audio devices, price of games, price to play online, game panel offers, manner to play like every controllers, motion gaming, virtual reality, sim racing, versatility with audio and video and all applications
